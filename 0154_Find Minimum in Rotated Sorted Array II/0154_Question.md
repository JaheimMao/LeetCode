# 0154_Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array ```nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7]``` might become:

+ ```[4,5,6,7,0,1,4]``` if it was rotated 4 times.
+ ```[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]``` if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array ```[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]``` 1 time results in the array ```[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]```.

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.
