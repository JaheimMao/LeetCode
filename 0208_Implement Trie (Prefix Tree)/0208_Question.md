# 0208_Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)

A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

+ ```Trie()``` Initializes the trie object.
+ ```void insert(String word)``` Inserts the string word into the trie.
+ ```boolean search(String word)``` Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
+ ```boolean startsWith(String prefix)``` Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.
